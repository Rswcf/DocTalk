You found a 60-page PDF you need to understand quickly. You search for "chat with PDF" and every tool wants you to create an account before you can try it. Name, email, password, verify email, accept terms — all before you know if the tool even works for your use case.

DocTalk takes a different approach. You can [start chatting with a PDF right now](/demo), without creating an account, without entering an email address, and without a credit card. This page explains exactly what you get for free and how to make the most of it.

## What the Free Demo Includes

The [DocTalk demo](/demo) gives you instant access to three sample documents:

1. **An earnings report** (Alphabet Q3 financials) — Test financial document analysis, data extraction, and quantitative questions
2. **A research paper** (the "Attention Is All You Need" transformer paper) — Test academic paper comprehension, methodology questions, and technical summarization
3. **A court filing** (a real legal document) — Test legal clause extraction, party identification, and procedural questions

For each document, you get:

- **5 messages per session** — Enough to ask several questions and follow up
- **50 sessions per document** — Start fresh conversations as needed
- **Citation highlighting** — Click any citation to see the source highlighted in the document
- **Full document viewer** — Scroll through the complete PDF alongside the chat
- **Quick AI mode** — Powered by DeepSeek V3.2 for fast answers

No account. No email. No credit card. Just click and chat.

## How to Use the Free Demo

### Step 1: Open the Demo

Go to [doctalk.site/demo](/demo). You will see three document cards with sample PDFs.

### Step 2: Pick a Document

Click any document to open it. The PDF loads in a viewer on one side, with the chat panel on the other. The document is already parsed and ready for questions.

### Step 3: Ask a Question

Type a question in the chat box and press Enter. The AI reads the relevant passages and generates an answer with numbered citations.

Try these to start:
- For the earnings report: "What was Google's revenue this quarter?"
- For the research paper: "Explain the self-attention mechanism in simple terms"
- For the court filing: "Who are the parties in this case and what is the dispute about?"

Click any citation number (like [1] or [2]) to jump to the source passage in the PDF. The text highlights so you can verify the answer immediately.

That is the entire workflow. No setup, no configuration, no waiting.

## Who Is This For?

The free demo is useful for anyone who wants to:

- **Evaluate AI PDF tools** without commitment — see the citation quality, response speed, and answer accuracy before deciding
- **Quick one-off queries** — you found a long document and need one answer fast
- **Show a colleague** what AI document chat looks like — share the demo link and they can try it immediately
- **Students and researchers** — limited budget but need to understand documents quickly

If you work with documents daily and find the tool useful, the free account (500 credits/month) covers light usage, and the Plus plan covers moderate use at $9.99/month.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Free Credits

### Use Quick Mode for Simple Lookups

Quick mode costs about 2 credits per question and is ideal for straightforward factual queries: "What date is mentioned on page 5?" or "How many participants were in the study?" Save Balanced mode (8 credits) for questions that require synthesis across multiple sections.

### Be Specific

Vague questions waste credits on broad, sometimes unfocused answers. "What is this about?" uses the same credits as "What was the year-over-year revenue change for the cloud division?" but the specific question gives you a much more useful answer.

### Upload the Right Documents

With 3 document slots on the free plan, choose the documents you query most frequently. You can delete a document and upload a new one when you are done with it.
