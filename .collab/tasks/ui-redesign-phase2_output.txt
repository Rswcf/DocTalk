Implemented the Phase 2 redesign exactly in code:

1. Header variant support
- Added `variant?: 'minimal' | 'full'` (default `full`) and conditional rendering/styling in `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx:16`.
- `minimal` now shows logo + `UserMenu` only with transparent background.
- `full` preserves existing controls and document context UI.

2. New landing components
- Added `HeroSection` at `frontend/src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx:1`.
- Added `FeatureGrid` at `frontend/src/components/landing/FeatureGrid.tsx:1`.

3. Homepage rewrite (logged-out + logged-in)
- Replaced `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:1` with the new layout:
- Logged-out: `Header` minimal, `HeroSection`, showcase image section, `FeatureGrid`, bottom `PrivacyBadge`.
- Logged-in: `Header` full, premium zinc upload card, updated document list cards, zinc primary “Open” action.
- Kept upload/polling/delete/localStorage merge logic intact.

Validation run:
- `npm run lint` passed (one pre-existing unrelated warning in `frontend/src/components/Profile/ProfileInfoSection.tsx:38` about `<img>`).
- `npm run build` failed due sandbox network restriction fetching Google Fonts (`fonts.googleapis.com`), not due these code changes.
