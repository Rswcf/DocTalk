Step 1 is complete.

- Updated `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:5` to remove `next/image` import.
- Replaced the showcase `<Image ... />` with the placeholder mockup at `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:134`.

Step 2 is complete.

- Ran `npm run lint` in `frontend/`.
- Result: success (exit code 0), with one existing warning in `frontend/src/components/Profile/ProfileInfoSection.tsx:38` about using `<img>`.

Step 3 and 4 could not be completed in this sandboxed environment.

- `git add -A && git commit ...` failed with:
  - `fatal: Unable to create '/Users/mayijie/Projects/Code/010_DocTalk/.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`
- `git push origin main` failed with:
  - `fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Rswcf/DocTalk.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com`

1. Run the same commit command locally (outside this sandbox) after `git add -A`.
2. Then run `git push origin main`.
