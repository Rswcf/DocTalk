Applied the Phase 3 restyle by fully replacing these files with the exact versions you provided:

- `frontend/src/app/demo/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/billing/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/auth/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/AuthModal.tsx`

What’s now in place:
- Zinc monochrome palette and `dark:bg-zinc-950` page backgrounds
- Updated header usage on Demo (`<Header variant="minimal" />`)
- Zinc primary button treatment (`bg-zinc-900 dark:bg-zinc-50 text-white dark:text-zinc-900`)
- Refined borders/cards/transitions and spacing per your specs
- Auth/AuthModal visual refresh including DocTalk wordmark and emoji removal in modal notes

Validation:
- Ran `npm run lint` in `frontend` successfully.
- One unrelated pre-existing warning remains at `frontend/src/components/Profile/ProfileInfoSection.tsx:38` (`<img>` vs `next/image`).
